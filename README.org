This repository contains some example Node.js applications with
deliberate security holes. We're using them to demonstrate basic
security practices.

** Before you start
You'll need to install [[https://nodejs.org/en/][Node.js]]. These applications were written with
Node v8.4.0, but older versions should still work.

** To run an application
Note that all the applications have security holes, so you might want
to run them inside a virtual machine if opening them up to a network.
By default the web-servers are accessible on 127.0.0.1 only, so should
only be accessible from your own machine.

First change into the application directory and install it's
dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd 01-notebook/
  npm install
#+END_SRC

Then, run the application using node:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  node server.js
#+END_SRC

You should see a message saying the server is available at
[[http://127.0.0.1:8080/][http://127.0.0.1:8080/]].
